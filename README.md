## Hi there 👋
I'm Subin, a curious builder and researcher passionate about language, learning, and human-machine collaboration.  
I specialize in **Natural Language Processing**, **Machine Learning**, and **UX/UI**, and I enjoy turning ideas into practical, elegant solutions.  
Most of my recent work involves **LLMs**, **model fine-tuning**, and designing systems that make AI more accessible and useful.  
When I'm not coding, you'll probably find me sketching interface ideas, reading about cognitive science, or tweaking prompts just for fun :)
